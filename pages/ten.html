    <div class="bottomTxt">Before you go home you stop to buy some scratchers. You scratch some of them and win nothing. Feeling defeated you head home. Once you make it back home you make dinner for you and your dogs. After dinner you scratch your last scratcher and to your surprise you won $2000! This will cover your rent and groceries for the rest of the month.</div>
